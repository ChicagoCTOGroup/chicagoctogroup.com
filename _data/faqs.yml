    - Do you have an existing connection in the group who would sponsor you?

    - What value or contribution do you see yourself making to the group?

    - What is your experience and position at a high level? (LinkedIn profile welcome)

    - What questions do you have about the group?

    - What can the Chicago CTO Group do for you?

    We will be glad to meet up for coffee and introduce you to the group.

    Sorry but this is not within the scope of the group. This group is for discussion and education first and foremost. If someone approaches you for more information, that's fair game. But no sales or pitching are allowed.
- question: "How does the group communicate?"

    - **Slack (chicagoctogroup.slack.com)**<br />This is the primary discussion and collaboration hub for the group. Send an email to the moderator with your preferred email address for an invite to the private Slack.

    - **Google Group (chicagoctogroup@googlegroups.com)**<br />This is the chanel for asynchronous communication for the group, where a thread format is more beneficial than a chatroom one and where discussions on specific topics may expand on longer periods of time.

    - **In Person**<br />Everyone likes meeting in person. We do so every month except in December. Our location rotates amongst the memberâ€™s offices every month on a rotating day of week. Invite with event details are disclosed on Slack and the Google group.
