									<p>The Chicago CTO Group values the participation of every member. We would like all members and anyone interacting with our members to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all members are expected to show respect and courtesy to others during all in-person and online interactions. All members, delegates/attendees, participants, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers participating in the Chicago CTO Group are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.<br><br>

									The Chicago CTO Group does not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any form. Harassment includes deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, sharing of sexual images in public spaces, unwelcome sexual attention, and offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

									</p>


									<h3 class="major">Reporting</h3>
									<p>
										If you are being harassed by a member of the Chicago CTO Group, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organizational team here. We will respond as promptly as we can. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse and we will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.<br><br>

										This code of conduct applies to Chicago CTO Group spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Chicago CTO Group members seriously. If the person who is harassing you is on the organizational team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. The organizational team reserves the right to exclude people from the Chicago CTO Group based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Chicago CTO Group spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Chicago CTO Group.

									</p>


									<h3 class="major">Consequences</h3>
									<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizational team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Chicago CTO Group spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other members or the general public.
									</p>
