            <p>Please send an email to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}" target="_blank">{{ site.email }}</a> with some additional context that answers the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What value or contribution do you see yourself making to the group?</li>
                <li>What is your experience and position at a high level? (linkedin profile welcome)</li>
                <li>What questions do you have about the group?</li>
                <li>What can the Chicago CTO Group do for you?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you know an existing member who is willing to sponsor you, please CC them on your introductory email.</p>
