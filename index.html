                        <strong>A “make the pie bigger” Mentality</strong><br>
                        We believe business is not a zero sum game.  By helping to grow executive leadership in Chicago, more opportunities will be created. We recognize that organizations may manage confidential information, however, many professional activities and challenges are correlated and we encourage feedback and knowledge share, whenever possible, in an intent to foster the growth of the Chicago technology scene.
